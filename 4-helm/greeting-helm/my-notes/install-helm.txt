#Installing Helm

$ choco install kubernetes-helm

#
This installs the Helm Client locally.

Now, we need to initialize Helm CLI, which effectively also installs the Tiller Server onto a Kubernetes cluster as identified through the Kubernetes configuration.
Please ensure that the Kubernetes cluster is running and accessible through kubectl before initializing Helm:

#

$ kubectl cluster-info
	Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:32768
	KubeDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:32768/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
