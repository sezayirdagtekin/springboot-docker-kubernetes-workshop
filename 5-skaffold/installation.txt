Skaffold is a command line tool that facilitates continuous development for Kubernetes-native applications.
Skaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing, and deploying your application, and provides building blocks for creating CI/CD pipelines.
This enables you to focus on iterating on your application locally while Skaffold continuously deploys to your local or remote Kubernetes cluster.
